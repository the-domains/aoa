  "What is the perfect age for bourbon?" is almost an unanswerable question. Or
  rather, there are so many different answers it may as well be. There are
  certainly whiskey lovers who believe older bourbon is better, but there are
  just as many folks out there who enjoy 8-12 year old bourbon just fine.
