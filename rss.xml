When Is a Spirit Too Old to Drink?</h1><p>The first time I tasted a superaged spirit-a rare 50-year-old Glenfiddich single malt scotch-I was taken aback. Not by the whiskey itself, but by the rapturous swooning of the whiskey geeks all around me at a tasting hosted by the whiskey brand. "It's chewy," one commented, smacking his lips for emphasis.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/10cf710b8a463d6824e13ce020032719b4374704.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This Guy Says He Can Make 20-Year-Old Rum in 6 Days</h1><p>The whiskey renaissance has the world clamoring for well-aged hooch, but the so-called brown spirits-whiskey, brandy, rum-have one widely-publicized problem. It takes time, and lots of it, to make them. Or at least to make them taste good.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e2f264af674f078576011df42ef310ffa99b617d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Perfect Age For Bourbon Probably Isn't What You Think - The Whiskey Wash</h1><p>"What is the perfect age for bourbon?" is almost an unanswerable question. Or rather, there are so many different answers it may as well be. There are certainly whiskey lovers who believe older bourbon is better, but there are just as many folks out there who enjoy 8-12 year old bourbon just fine.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/05e8139141fafc7ab4ee77386da042162d3cd9d7.jpg"></article>]]></description>
